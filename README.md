# old_log_viewer

In this repository, I uploaded 2 different well logging viewers during specialization project and thesis. The main description of each well log viewers are shown below.
<p><b>1. Well logging viewer 1.</b> The logging viewer has 6 tracks and limited for viewing 1 well source. Multiple loggings can be shown in one track. The highlight feature in this viewer is the option of lithology preview inside the logging track.
<p><b>2. Well logging viewer 2.</b> The logging viewer has 3 tracks. Within each track, users can select type of well logging to be shown and users can also select the well source. More than one well sources can be loaded in the logging viewer allowing users to read and compare well logging from several wells. The type of well logging in this interface is a default and user can't interactively add or remove logging graph. The highlighted feature in this viewer is that users can get the data value by clicking the logging graph.
