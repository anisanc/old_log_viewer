# README LOG VIEWER 1

Within the folder, you will find *.m and *.fig of the interface.
Additional notes:
<ol>
<li> The interface is designed to load a particular well scource by default. Due to huge file size, the well logging files are uploaded in: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kbxp8v3e0zgcti9/AAAZsrub_suLO6mVVPgO7QB5a?dl=0 </li>
<li> Adding well logging type into the track can be done by pressing CTRL button </li> </ol>

PS: The codes are quite messy due to first experience of the creators in making an interface
